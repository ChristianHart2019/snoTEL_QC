# Find GHCND ID #s 

Use FIND_snoTEL_GHCND_IDs.m to find the GHCND ID numbers that correspond to the USDAâ€™s Snow Telemetry Data Collection Network's location and IDs (snoTEL). To do this, use a file called ghcnd-stations.txt, which was downloaded from https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-inventory.txt. A list of snoTEL stations will also have to be used, snoTELstations.mat.
